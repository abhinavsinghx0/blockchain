## History
  Blockchain technology gained popularity after Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper about Bitcoin, a digital currency system that allowed transactions to be recorded on a public ledger without a third party. The financial crisis in the US in 2008 increased interest in Bitcoin and blockchain as a potentially more stable and secure alternative to traditional banking systems.
  
## Blockchain
  Blockchain is a secure and decentralized digital ledger that records transactions without the need for a central authority.It is secure and decentralized because multiple computers validate and record each transaction, making it difficult for any one entity to manipulate the ledger, and there is no central point of control or failure.
  
## Ledger
  A ledger is like a diary which is used to record all transactions/data of a system.
  
## Block
  In a blockchain, a block is a group of transactions that are added together. Each block has a maximum size, and it usually includes the current and previous block's unique identifiers(hash), a timestamp, a nonce, and the transactions that are being added to the blockchain.
  
## Concensus mechanism
  Concensus mechanism is a process of validation of transactions.It defines how the new block connects with existing chain.The first block of a blockchain is called the *genesis block*.
  
## Bitcoin
  - Bitcoin Protocol:
                    The Bitcoin protocol is a set of rules and specifications that govern how the Bitcoin network operates.The bitcoin protocol sets rules for creating new bitcoins,it allows users to create digital wallets to store, send, and receive bitcoins.
            
  -Bitcoin Cryptocurrency:
                        Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that allows users to send and receive payments.
  
## Ethereum
  Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts.It uses Ether(ETH) as cryptocurrency.Smart contract are like a programming script in which we can build function.Smart contracts are almost immutable.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine 
  EVM is a software environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, using a gas-based fee system.

## Whitepaper
  A whitepaper is a document that describes a particular technology, product, or concept in detail, often used in the context of startups and emerging technologies. 
  
## Blockchains layers
  - Blockchain layers represent the functionality of a plateform. For example, layer 0 blockchain contains fundamentls like how transactions will done , how it connect on internet ,how it uses hardware etc.
  
 - layer 1 blockchains are created by implementing concensus mechanism like "proof of work" on layer 0.Thus layer 1 provide more security.*layer1 is based on security*
-  layer 2 is based on scalability.They uses more efficient concensus machenism like "Proof-of-stake" and they can use off-chain solutions to process transactions, which reduces the burden on the main blockchain.So layer 2 are more faster and cheaper than layer1
- layer3 , It provides more functionality and services like connecting with centrilized database , creating dapp etc . it provides better UI.

Note: Every layer is built on top of the other. This means that if a change is made in a layer, it will affect all the layers above it.
