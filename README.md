## 1- History:
  Blockchain technology gained popularity after Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper about Bitcoin, a digital currency system that allowed transactions to be recorded on a public ledger without a third party. The financial crisis in the US in 2008 increased interest in Bitcoin and blockchain as a potentially more stable and secure alternative to traditional banking systems.
  
## Blockchain
  Blockchain is a secure and decentralized digital ledger that records transactions without the need for a central authority.It is secure and decentralized because multiple computers validate and record each transaction, making it difficult for any one entity to manipulate the ledger, and there is no central point of control or failure.
  
## Ledger
  A ledger is like a diary which is used to record all transactions/data of a system.
  
## Block
  In a blockchain, a block is a group of transactions that are added together. Each block has a maximum size, and it usually includes the current and previous block's unique identifiers(hash), a timestamp, a nonce, and the transactions that are being added to the blockchain.
  
## Concensus mechanism
  Concensus mechanism is a process of validation of transactions.It defines how the new block connects with existing chain.The first block of a blockchain is called the *genesis block*.
  
## Bitcoin
  - Bitcoin Protocol:
                    The Bitcoin protocol is a set of rules and specifications that govern how the Bitcoin network operates.The bitcoin protocol sets rules for creating new bitcoins,it allows users to create digital wallets to store, send, and receive bitcoins.
            
  -Bitcoin Cryptocurrency:
                        Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that allows users to send and receive payments.
  
## Ethereum
  Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts.It uses Ether(ETH) as cryptocurrency.Smart contract are like a programming script in which we can build function.Smart contracts are almost immutable.

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
  EVM is a software environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, using a gas-based fee system.
